 About the Project

This shopping list application was created to solve the common problem of disorganized shopping and forgotten items. The motivation behind this project was to provide users with a simple, intuitive tool that helps them:

- Organize their shopping needs efficiently
- Never forget important items with categorized lists
- Save time by having everything planned in advance
- Access their lists from any device with a modern, responsive interface

The project demonstrates modern React development practices, state management with Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript for type safety. It serves as both a practical tool for everyday use and a showcase of current web development best practices.

 How to Use the App

Getting Started
1. Register - Create a new account by providing your email, first name, last name, cell number, and password. The system will validate your email and ensure it's unique.
2. Login - Sign in using your registered email and password. You'll be redirected to the dashboard upon successful authentication.
3. Create Lists - Click the "New List" button on the dashboard to create your first shopping list. Give it a descriptive name like "Weekly Groceries" or "Party Supplies".
4. Add Items - Click on any list to view its details, then add items by specifying the item name, quantity, and category (e.g., "Produce", "Dairy", "Meat").
5. Manage Lists - Edit list names, delete lists you no longer need, or search through your lists using the search bar at the top of the dashboard.
6. Update Profile - Click on your profile to update personal information or change your password for security.

User Flow
1. Registration/Login - Dashboard - Create List - Add Items - Manage Lists
   - Start by creating an account or logging in with existing credentials

2. Search - Use the search bar to find specific lists or items
   - Type in the search bar to instantly filter your lists
   - Search works across list names and item names
   - Results update in real-time as you type
   - Clear search to see all lists again

3. Sort - Sort lists by date, name, or category
   - Sort by newest first to see your most recent lists
   - Sort by oldest first to see your oldest lists
   - Sort alphabetically by list name (A-Z or Z-A)
   - Sort by category to group lists by their primary item type

4. Profile - Update your profile information and change password
   - Access profile settings from the header menu
   - Update personal information like name and contact details
   - Change your password for enhanced security
   - All changes are saved automatically

5. List Management - Detailed list operations
   - View list details by clicking on any list card
   - Add new items with name, quantity, and category
   - Edit existing items or remove items you no longer need
   - Delete entire lists when they're no longer relevant
   - See item counts and creation dates for each list

 Technologies Used

 Frontend Technologies
- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks, concurrent features, and component-based architecture
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development with strict type checking
- **Redux Toolkit** - Predictable state management with RTK Query for data fetching
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing and navigation
- **Redux Persist** - State persistence across browser sessions
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS styling for component isolation
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API communication

 Backend & Database
- **JSON Server** - RESTful API mock server for development and testing
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing and verification for secure authentication

 Development Tools
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server with HMR
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting with TypeScript support
- **TypeScript Compiler** - Type checking and compilation
- **Concurrently** - Run multiple development servers simultaneously
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting for deployment

 Design Patterns & Architecture
- **Component-Based Architecture** - Reusable, modular UI components
- **Container/Presentational Pattern** - Separation of logic and presentation
- **Redux Pattern** - Centralized state management with actions and reducers
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)** - Component composition and reusability
- **Custom Hooks** - Logic extraction and reuse across components

 Approach

This project was built using modern React development practices and follows several key design principles:

 Architecture Decisions
- **TypeScript First** - Full type safety throughout the application to catch errors early
- **Redux Toolkit** - Centralized state management for predictable data flow
- **Component Composition** - Small, focused components that can be easily tested and reused
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling to prevent CSS conflicts and improve maintainability

 Development Methodology
- **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive design starting from mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with React
- **User-Centric Design** - Intuitive interface with clear user flows and feedback
- **Data Validation** - Comprehensive validation at both client and server levels

 Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure** - Components, services, and utilities organized by feature
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Custom Hooks** - Logic extraction for reusability and testability
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling and user feedback

 Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading** - Code splitting for better initial load times
- **Memoization** - React.memo and useMemo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient State Updates** - Immutable updates and normalized state structure
- **Bundle Optimization** - Vite for fast builds and optimized production bundles
